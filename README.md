tablesorter-grouping
====================

A widget for [TableSorter](http://tablesorter.com/) that groups columns with a matching key. It provides zebra striping that is sensitive to the grouping
and tags the grouped rows for your CSS modification pleasure. The `demo.html` file is a basic demo, which is published
[here](http://files.enfranchisedmind.com/tablesorter-grouping/demo.html): to see the sorting magic in action, hold the shift key and click on the
first thread headers.
